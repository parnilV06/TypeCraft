## 📌 About the Project

**TypeCraft** is a clean and focused typing speed test web application designed to help users measure and improve their typing skills without distractions.

Inspired by modern developer tools and minimal UX principles, TypeCraft prioritizes:
- clarity over clutter  
- accuracy over gimmicks  
- focus over features  

This project is built as a **learning-first project**, focusing on solid frontend fundamentals, clean UI design, and correct typing-test logic.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Select your preferred test settings (duration & difficulty)
2. Click **Start Test**
3. The timer begins on your **first keypress**
4. Type the displayed words as accurately and quickly as possible
5. View detailed results at the end of the test

The test logic is based on **character-level comparison**, ensuring realistic and fair accuracy calculations.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- Monospace typography for typing content
- Minimal color palette with subtle feedback
- No unnecessary animations or distractions
- UI reacts to state — not manual DOM manipulation

The goal is to make typing feel **natural, focused, and intentional**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** (Functional Components & Hooks)
- **CSS** (Custom styling, no UI frameworks)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**

No external typing libraries are used — all logic is implemented from scratch for learning purposes.
